# Data-Analysis-Portfolio.
This is a repository that I have created to showcase skills, share projects and track my progress in Data Analytics.
## About
Hi, I'm Sonia!
  I'm currently following a Data Analyitics Course at GoIt Romania and here is where I would like to present the projects I have worked on so far.

## Projects
In this section I will list data analytics projects briefly explaining what I did for each one.
### Google Sheets
  - Project 1: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1t7Bh5xxSYAe_CEy7jLbcuJJXac4E6_NlUkJtuQH8CD4/edit?usp=sharing- 
    -  Calculated product metrics and evaluating the effectiveness of user acquisition spend.
  - Project 2: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10NTjjDbfkB_DYtJ0qIhoEuMCd8cG-ibywGrMYjgnEoQ/edit?usp=sharing
    - Calculated product engagement metrics.
    - Used linear regression to predict values and created graphs.
    - Created tables showcasing user retention rate.

### SQL ( All of the data from these projects was extracted from a database provided by GoIt Romania ) 
  - Project 1: https://github.com/SoniaMoldovan21/Data-Analysis-Portfolio./blob/e34cce1319bb8577b0f2d2e049f21908f2ee3d6c/Project%201%20SQL.sql
      - Created a temporary function that extracts the name of the ad campaign from a URL.
      - Used functions to manipulate strings, find matches, and combine multiple tables.
      - Utilized conditional statements and performed logical operations to deal with missing data according to specified conditions.
  - Project 2 : https://github.com/SoniaMoldovan21/Data-Analysis-Portfolio./blob/50a78594de28f893cd3abf15cf3aea479e49a283/Project%202%20SQL.sql
      - Using the same CTE from the previous project I added the first day of the month from the date when the ad was displayed.
      - For every campaign I created a new field in each month that shows the difference between CPM, CTR, and ROMI in the current month compared to the previous month in percentage.
### Tableau 
  - Project 1 : https://public.tableau.com/views/Project1_17324639274970/Dashboard2?:language=en-US&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link
      - The table in the middle represents a cohort analysis of  monthly revenue from users.
      - The left graph shows the change in total revenue as a percentage relative to the previous month.
      - The bottom right graph shows the sum of revenue received from new users during the calendar month when they became paying.
  - Project 2 : https://public.tableau.com/views/Project2_17324638664070/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link
      - fgsw
      - The left graph shows how many of
